This program was created to turn a Minecraft map art containing 256 player heads into a design, by reorganising the heads to match a given design. <br>
The original map art, "The Aggregate" from the About Oliver Minecraft Server, was used, and is contained in the release as an example, with a design matching the logo of the About Oliver Youtube channel. However, this took can be used to reorganise any map art of player heads into a design. <br>
All instructions for use are displayed upon opening the executable.
